                    <h2>1900-1930's</h2>
                    <p>1902: Real Madrid was founded by brothers Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós on March 6, 1902. Initially called Madrid Football Club, the club was created to compete in the growing sport of football in Spain. It initially participated in regional competitions and began building a local reputation.
                        1905: The club won its first Spanish Cup (known as the Copa del Rey today), defeating Athletic Club in the final. This victory helped to solidify the club’s importance in Spanish football.
                        1920: After gaining the royal seal of approval from King Alfonso XIII, Madrid Football Club became Real Madrid. The "Real" title signified its official recognition by the Spanish monarchy.
                        1920s-1930s: The 1920s were a formative period for Real Madrid, with the club steadily growing in stature. The Campo de Chamartín, their first home, was inaugurated in 1924, and the club began to attract more prestigious players. They struggled to compete with FC Barcelona, but Real Madrid remained a force in Spain, winning the Spanish Championship (predecessor to La Liga) in 1929–30.

                        <h2>1930-1940's</h2>
                        <p>1930s: As the 1930s unfolded, Real Madrid became more established in Spain, although the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) interrupted the development of Spanish football. Despite the upheaval, Real Madrid continued to build its influence and won its first Spanish Cup (Copa del Rey) after the war in 1943.
                            Santiago Bernabéu: In 1943, Santiago Bernabéu became president of the club. His leadership would prove critical in the coming decades, as he undertook ambitious projects to build the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (opened in 1947) and modernized the club’s operations. He emphasized youth development and attracting top talent from abroad, which would later pay off.
                            Bernabéu's efforts transformed Real Madrid into one of the most recognizable football clubs globally, creating the foundation for its future success.

                <h2>European Golden Age</h2>
                <p>1955–1960 – Rise to European Dominance: The formation of the European Cup (now UEFA Champions League) in 1955 marked a new chapter for European football. Real Madrid entered the competition and quickly established themselves as the team to beat.
                    In 1956, Real Madrid won the inaugural European Cup, defeating Rheims 4–3 in the final. Alfredo Di Stéfano played a pivotal role in this victory. The club went on to dominate European football, winning five consecutive European Cups (1956–1960), a feat that remains unmatched in the tournament’s history.
                    Alfredo Di Stéfano: Di Stéfano was instrumental in Real Madrid’s rise to prominence. His versatility as a forward, playmaker, and leader on the field set him apart. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. Di Stéfano's signing in 1953 was a masterstroke, as he led the team to numerous domestic and international titles.
                    Francisco Gento: Gento was another star player during this period. Known for his incredible speed, Gento was one of the key figures behind Real Madrid's successes. His dribbling and ability to stretch opposition defenses made him a key weapon on the wing.
                    Ferenc Puskás: The signing of Ferenc Puskás in 1958 further solidified Real Madrid’s European dominance. The Hungarian forward was one of the greatest goal scorers in history. His partnership with Di Stéfano helped the team maintain their superiority in Europe.
                    1959–1960 – European Glory: <br>
                    In 1959, Real Madrid secured their fifth consecutive European Cup, defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 in the final. This match is remembered for its thrilling attacking play, with Puskás scoring four goals. Real Madrid's dominance in Europe during this period was unprecedented, and the club's stature grew significantly.

                <h2>Decline and "galactios" era</h2>
                <p>1990s – Transition and Decline in Europe: The 1990s marked a period of decline for Real Madrid, particularly in European competitions. Despite winning La Liga titles in 1995 and 1997, the club failed to make a significant impact in the Champions League, which had become increasingly competitive.
                    The period also saw Jorge Valdano and Vicente del Bosque manage the team, but the club’s European ambitions were frustrated by rivals such as AC Milan and Juventus.
                    Galácticos Era – Early 2000s: With Florentino Pérez becoming president in 2000, Real Madrid embarked on a bold new era of signing superstars. This era, known as the Galácticos era, saw the club bring in the world’s best players, starting with the signing of Luis Figo from Barcelona in 2000.
                    Zinedine Zidane (2001), Ronaldo Nazário (2002), and David Beckham (2003) followed, creating one of the most star-studded squads in football history. While the club won domestic trophies, including La Liga, the lack of a cohesive team often hindered their ability to compete consistently in Europe.
                    2002 UEFA Champions League: The 2002 Champions League was a standout moment in the Galácticos era. Real Madrid defeated Bayer Leverkusen 2–1 in the final, with Zinedine Zidane scoring one of the most iconic goals in football history: a stunning volley.

                <h2>Jose muourinho and zinedine Zidane <br> domination</h2>
                <p>José Mourinho (2010–2013): Mourinho was appointed in 2010 and instilled a tactical discipline that returned Real Madrid to the top of Spanish football. In 2012, he led the club to a La Liga title, breaking several records, including the most points in a season (100). His rivalry with Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona became one of the defining storylines of European football.
                    Zinedine Zidane (2016–2018): Zidane’s arrival in 2016 marked a new era of European dominance. Zidane masterminded a remarkable run in the UEFA Champions League, guiding Real Madrid to three consecutive Champions League titles in 2016, 2017, and 2018.
                    Cristiano Ronaldo was pivotal in these victories, as his goals propelled the club to glory. Zidane’s tactical mastery, combined with a squad featuring players like Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, and Luka Modrić, solidified Real Madrid’s legacy as a modern European giant.

                <h2>Cristiano ronaldos era</h2>
                <p>Ronaldo quickly became the focal point of Real Madrid’s attack. In his first season (2009–2010), he scored an impressive 33 goals in 35 La Liga appearances, finishing as the club’s top scorer. However, Real Madrid finished second in La Liga, trailing Barcelona, who were in the midst of an extraordinary period under manager Pep Guardiola.
                    Cristiano’s impact was immediate, and the Portuguese forward demonstrated an exceptional goal-scoring record, winning the Pichichi Trophy (awarded to La Liga's top scorer) in the 2010–2011 season, with 53 goals in 54 appearances across all competitions.
                    Champions League and Rivalry with Barcelona: One of the most significant storylines of the early years of Ronaldo’s time at Real Madrid was the intense rivalry with Barcelona. With Lionel Messi in the prime of his career and Pep Guardiola overseeing Barcelona’s golden generation, the two clubs clashed repeatedly in both La Liga and the Copa del Rey.
                    In the 2011 Copa del Rey final, Ronaldo scored the winning goal in extra time, securing Real Madrid's first major trophy in nearly three years. The 1–0 victory over Barcelona was symbolic of the growing strength of Real Madrid under Ronaldo’s leadership.
                    Despite Real Madrid’s growing competitiveness, the team continued to fall short in the Champions League against formidable teams like Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
