        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>Build Your Project: Once the hackathon begins, you and your team will have a set amount of time (usually 24-48 hours) to work<br> on your project. The theme or challenge will be revealed during the kickoff, and you'll need to create a solution
            that aligns with it.<br> Whether its an app, website, or prototype, youll use your skills and creativity to bring your idea to life. Throughout the event,<br> you can use various tools and resources, and you'll have access to mentors who can
