            <h2><strong>Technology at GOA Oriented Academy</h2></strong>
                <p class="p2">Coding technology encompasses a broad range of tools and practices. Python is widely used for data science, AI, and web development, while JavaScript powers web development with frameworks like React and Node.js. Java is common in enterprise applications and Android development, and C++ is used for performance-critical systems and gaming. Ruby is popular for web development with Ruby on Rails, and Go is designed for scalable cloud systems. Swift is used for iOS/macOS development, and Rust focuses on memory safety in systems programming. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are key for front-end development, while Node.js, Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails dominate back-end development. For mobile, React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin are essential for building cross-platform apps. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras are widely used, alongside tools like Scikit-learn for data science. Databases are split into relational ones like MySQL and PostgreSQL and NoSQL options like MongoDB and Cassandra. DevOps tools like Git for version control, Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI for CI/CD automation, and Docker and Kubernetes for containerization are integral. Cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer vast cloud services, with serverless computing tools like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions enabling event-driven architectures. Security practices, including ethical hacking and the OWASP guidelines, ensure code safety. Development methodologies like Agile, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Pair Programming emphasize collaboration and quality, while UX/UI design tools like Figma and Adobe XD focus on creating intuitive user interfaces. These technologies continuously evolve to meet new demands in software development.</p>
